# div-python-project
I did these projects to learn how to code with Python. It also includes my final exam of my COMP201 class.

## File
- `pizza_calculator.py`: defines functions for calculating the fair quantity and price of small pizzas compared to a large pizza based on their diameters and prices, and provides a menu for the user to choose between quantity or price mode.
- DIRECTORY: `cyphering`: defines two functions for performing Caesar and Vigenère ciphers on a given input string, with encryption and decryption modes. The Caesar cipher shifts characters in the alphabet by a fixed key, while the Vigenère cipher uses a keyword to shift characters by varying amounts.
- DIRECTORY: `scrabble`: plays a scrabble game! Just run: `scrabble.py`
- `assignment4.py`: final exam for a COMP201 class
